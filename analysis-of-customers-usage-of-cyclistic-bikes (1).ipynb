Since then, the offering has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across chicago. Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The director of marketing has a set goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.\n\nAs a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team, I have been tasked to help the team understand how casual riders and annual members use cyclistic bikes differently by backing up my recommendations with compelling data insights and Data Visualization techniques.
